# What Is a Conclusion in a Research Paper?

A conclusion is the final section of your research paper.
It brings everything together by:
- Summarizing your main findings
- Explaining why those findings matter
- Suggesting what future researchers can explore next

Think of it as the part where you wrap up the story of your research and leave readers with the key message.

# How to write a strong conclusion
A good conclusion is short, clear, and meaningful. Here’s a simple structure you can follow:

- **Restate thesis statement:** Reiterate your main thesis statement or research question to remind readers of its importance.

Start by reminding readers what your study was about.

Example:
“This study investigated the impact of study habits on student performance.”

You don’t need to repeat the exact same sentence from the introduction — just state the idea again in a fresh way.

- **Summarize key findings:** Provide a concise summary of your main findings, highlighting their relevance and contribution to the field.
Briefly highlight the main results of your research.

Example:
“The results showed that consistent study routines improved overall performance across all grade levels.”

Keep it concise — you’re not repeating the entire discussion.

- **Highlight the Significance**

Explain why your findings matter.

Example:
“These findings provide useful insights for educators who want to improve student learning outcomes.”

- **Suggest further research:** Identify potential avenues for future research based on the limitations or unanswered questions revealed by your study.

End by pointing out what researchers can explore next.

Example:
“Future studies could examine how digital learning tools influence study habits.”

This shows awareness of your study’s scope and limitations.


# Tenses to Use in the Conclusion

Using the correct tense makes your conclusion clearer and more professional.

- **Past tense** is used to summarize the main findings. the major implications of the study and the limitation of your work. Example: “The study revealed significant regional variations.” Summarizes main results and their significance.Example: "The study demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method."

  ✔ Past Tense — For Summarizing Findings

Use past tense when talking about what your study found because these actions are already completed.

Examples:

“The study revealed significant regional variations.”

“The analysis showed a strong relationship between attendance and grades.”

“The study demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.”

  
- **Future tense** is used to offer suggestion for future research, Example: “Future studies will explore the role of adaptive strategies. "Suggests directions for future research. Example: "Future studies will focus on expanding the sample size."

  ✔ Future Tense — For Suggestions and Recommendations

Use future tense when pointing toward future research directions.

Examples:

“Future studies will explore the role of adaptive learning strategies.”

“Future research will focus on a larger sample size.”

“Further work will investigate long-term behavioral impacts.”
