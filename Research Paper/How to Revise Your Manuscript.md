## 1. Master Nominalizations
Look closely at nouns that could be stronger as verbs.

**Example:**
- ❌ *The analysis of the data revealed…*
- ✅ *We analyzed the data and found…*

Using verbs instead of abstract nouns makes sentences clearer and more direct.

## 2. Clarify Your Sentences
For each sentence, ask:

> **“What is this sentence about?”**

- Identify the sentence subject  
- Check whether the subject truly reflects the main idea  

Clear subjects lead to clear sentences.

## 3. Check Sentence Links
Ensure each sentence connects smoothly to the previous one.

- Identify the linking word or idea  
- Check whether the connection appears at the **beginning** or **end** of the sentence  

Good links improve flow and readability.

## 4. Ensure Cohesion in Paragraphs
Every paragraph should focus on **one main idea**.

- Do all sentences support the main point?  
- Do the first and last sentences discuss the same topic?  

Remove or revise sentences that drift away from the main idea.

## 5. Read Aloud
Read your manuscript aloud or use text-to-speech software.

- Listen for awkward phrasing  
- Notice where your attention drops  

If it sounds confusing, it probably is.

## 6. Seek Feedback
Share your manuscript with an intelligent outside reader.

- Ask where they get lost  
- Note areas that need clarification  

Fresh eyes often catch problems you miss.

---

## 7. Ditch Unnecessary Words and Phrases
Search for words that add little or no meaning, such as:

- *very*  
- *it should be noted*  
- *the fact that*  
- *framework*  
- *mechanism*  
- *utilize / usage*  

Cutting unnecessary words makes your writing sharper and more professional.
