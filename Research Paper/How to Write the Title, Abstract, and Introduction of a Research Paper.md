# **üß© How to Write a Strong Title** 

A research paper title should be concise, informative, and precise ‚Äî it captures what your study is about without unnecessary words.

## **‚úÖ Key Guidelines**

- Keep it under 20 words.
- Avoid rare abbreviations and punctuation marks like colons or question marks.
- Make sure it reflects the main topic or finding of your study.
- Begin with the subject, not the method.
- Use simple and searchable language that helps others find your paper easily.

## Example Titles:

- ‚ÄúDeep Learning Models for Early Detection of Skin Cancer‚Äù
- ‚ÄúGene X Is Required for Intestinal Cell Differentiation‚Äù
  
These titles are short, specific, and tell readers exactly what to expect.

## **Tense**
- For many journals, the manuscript title does not need to be a complete sentence, and no verb is necessary .
- In cases where a complete sentence is appropriate, use the simple present tense to describe a conclusion that the manuscript supports (e.g., ‚ÄúGene X is required for intestinal cell differentiation‚Äù or ‚ÄúFrameshift mutations in gene X cause abnormal notochord development in zebrafish‚Äù).


## **Writing**

- A Good title should contain the fewest possible words that adequately describe the content of the paper
- Keep title short
- Title identify the main issue of the paper
- Title begin with the subject of the paper
- Title Do not contain infrequently used abbreviations
- Make them easy for indexing and searching informative attractive, effective
- Keep the title simple and Specific to describe the content but not so technical it cannot be easily understood, Try to be concise
- Titel should be under 20 words long

## **Reviwer Comments**

- To aid our readers, and to maximize the accessibility of your manuscript, the title should have a clear, precise scientific meaning without unnecessary punctuations (e.g. without colon, -, question mark).

Please ensure title change is made in all respective file where title has been given.

# üìÑ Writing an Effective Abstract 

The abstract is your paper in miniature. It summarizes your objectives, methods, key findings, and conclusions ‚Äî all in 250‚Äì300 words.A brief summary of the research paper, highlighting its objectives, methods, key findings, and conclusions.

## **üéØ Why Your Abstract Is Important**

5 reasons why your abstract is important

- Quick Overview ‚Äì Gives readers a snapshot of your study.The abstract provides a **quick overview**: The abstract is the first section of a scientific paper that readers encounter. Therefore, it should provide a brief overview of the entire paper, including your key findings
- Visibility ‚Äì Indexed by databases like Google Scholar or PubMed.A well-written abstract increases accessibility and **visibility**: Abstracts are often published in databases and indexes which allows researchers to search for papers based on specific keywords in search engines such as Google Scholar, the Web of Science Master Journal List, or PubMed.
- Saves Time ‚Äì Helps readers decide if your paper is relevant.Abstracts save researchers and journal editors time: Researchers often need to read through many papers to find the information they need. The abstract allows readers to quickly determine if a paper is relevant to their needs, saving them time and effort.
- Improves Understanding ‚Äì Highlights your key results.
- Supports Critical Evaluation ‚Äì Allows readers to assess your research quality.This allows readers to evaluate the quality and reliability of the research and determine if the conclusions are supported by the evidence presented.

## Type of Abstract

- Descriptive: A short summary (no results).A brief snapshot of your study, think "teaser trailer." It mentions the purpose, methods, scope but skips results and conclusions.
- Informative: Includes purpose, methods, and key results.The whole story in a nutshell. Covers purpose, methods, key findings and conclusions.
- Critical: Adds a brief evaluation.Adds a layer of evaluation or critique. Great for papers where interpretation matters as much as results.
- Structured: Uses labeled sections like Objective, Methods, Results, Conclusion.Divided into sections like Objective, Methods, Results and Conclusion. Perfect for systematic reviews, clinical studies and scientific journals.
- Graphical: Presents findings visually through flowcharts or diagrams.A visual representation of your research. These abstracts use diagrams, flowcharts or infographics to summarize your study at a glance.
Ideal for visually communicating complex findings or attracting attention in journals with broad audiences.


## üí° Abstract Writing Tips

- Start with the **research problem** and why it matters. State the why behind your research in one clear sentence.
- Include key **methods** and **main results** ‚Äî even statistically significant ones.
- Be **concise** but **complete** ‚Äî no jargon or citations.
- Follow your **journal‚Äôs format**.
- Revise and proofread carefully ‚Äî clarity is everything.
-  Mention the problem or question you‚Äôre addressing. It shows your study's relevance.
- kip the fluff! Include only the most impactful findings.
- abstracts are 250-300 words. Make every word count. Be Concise, Yet Complete.
- ise, Revise, Revise: Treat your abstract like a mini research paper. Proofread for clarity, flow and accuracy.
- Introduction/ Background: Briefly introduce the topic and the research problem.
- Objectives: Clearly state the primary objective(s) of the research
- Methods: Summarize the research design and methodology.
- Results: Highlight the main findings of the research.
- Conclusions: Provide the main conclusions and the implications of the study
- Honest and precise
- can standalone (search engines, sometimes all people read)
- No technical jargon
- Short and Specific
- Cites no references
- The abstract is short but remember not to cram as much detail into it as possible; you want to grab the reader‚Äôs attention with the first statement

  ## Tense
  
The verb tense chosen for the abstract should be based on the section of the text to which each sentence corresponds. For example, **introductory statements** describing the current understanding of the issue should use the **present tense**, **references to previous research** should use the **present perfect**, and **descriptions of the methods and results** should use the **past tense**.

- **Present tense** is used for highlighting the gaps the aim and objective of and the application. **Example** ‚ÄúThis study examines the effects of climate change on agriculture.‚Äù
- **Present Tense:** Stating the papers overall argument or conclusion **Example:** This paper demonstrates that X improve learning outcome
- **Past Tense**: Summarizes the methods used and key findings of the study. **Example**: "Data was collected through surveys and analyzed using SPSS."
- **Past tense**: Summarizes methodology and key results. **Example**: ‚ÄúThe data were collected using satellite imagery. **Example:** "We conducted experiments, and the results showed significant improvement."
- **Past Perfect Tense:** Highlights achievements. **Example**: "The team had successfully developed a new algorithm for data processing.

  ## Reviewer Comments

  - The abstract must mention the results in terms of statistically explicitly
  - the keywords mentioned in the abstract were not reflected in the abstract.
  - The author needs to change the abstract and focus more on the problem domain. Before the paper contributions, the author could precisely include the need of developing the proposed method.

#  Introduction  

The introduction sets the stage for your research. It should clearly state the problem, explain why it matters, and lead the reader toward your objectives and contributions.
This section provides an overview of the research topic, presents the research question or hypothesis, and outlines the significance and relevance of the study. The introduction sets the stage for your research paper and should captivate the reader‚Äôs interest while providing essential background information.

The introduction of your paper is your first opportunity to engage your readers. It should clearly outline the problem at hand, why it matters, and what your contributions will be. Avoid vague statements; instead, provide concrete examples and a clear roadmap of what the reader can expect.

## üß± Ideal Paragraph Structure

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Paragraph 1**: Introduce your research question and explain why it‚Äôs important.

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Paragraph 2**: Summarize what prior studies have found ‚Äî keep it short and relevant.

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Paragraph 3**: Identify what gaps or problems remain.

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Paragraph 4:** Present how your research addresses those gaps and what it contributes.

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Paragraph 1:** What is the paper about and why is it important? By the end of the first paragraph, readers should know your answers to these questions. Although you may see advice to start with the general topic and use a "reverse funnel" outline, that can lead to long, meandering introductions. If you are starting with, "Creativity is increasingly important in work today," you are probably starting too generally. Try starting as close to your research question or phenomenon as you can. Two common approaches are (a) start with a real-world example of the phenomenon you are studying or (b) start with a question about the phenomenon (e.g., How do leaders know when to intervene to help their teams?).

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Paragraph 2:** What has research already found about this phenomenon? As I wrote in a prior post, this is your chance to characterize the literature. Start the paragraph with the point you want to make, e.g., "Despite its importance, research on listening in organizations remains fragmented" (from Yip & Fisher, 2022). Then, back up your assertion. But be careful not to get too technical; avoid jargon unless it is essential. Try to confine this description of the literature to 4-6 sentences.

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Paragraph 3:** What unsolved issues are there that research has not yet addressed, or has addressed in fragmented or contradictory ways? Why is that an important problem? The last question is commonly overlooked - what are the consequences of never solving this problem? What might we mis-explain or predict -- and why would that be so terrible?

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Paragraph 4:** What is this paper going to do to solve that problem? Here, you can give an overview of the paper, including its main hypotheses (e.g., "We develop and test hypotheses..."), methods, and contributions.

## üß≠ Writing Tips

- Hook the reader with a strong opening statement.
- Provide context ‚Äî connect your study to the broader field.
- Clearly state your research question or hypothesis.
- End with an overview of what follows.
- Emphasize your novelty and contributions.

- The introduction should introduce the topic of the paper, provide background information, and state the thesis statement.
- Investing time in crafting a strong introduction can significantly improve the likelihood of your paper being read in its entirety. Remember, many readers will drop off after the first page, so make those words count.
- When writing the introduction pick out the things that are most relevant to your work and explain why. Present the background of your work while focusing on the most important issues.this section aims to provide the relevant background and rationale for your work, as well as specify its novelty and contribution;
- Hook the reader: Begin with an attention-grabbing opening sentence or anecdote that relates to your research topic.
- Provide context: Introduce the research topic and its significance in a broader context, highlighting any relevant background information or previous studies.
- State the research question or hypothesis: Clearly articulate your main research question or hypothesis to guide the reader throughout the paper.
- Outline the paper‚Äôs structure: Briefly mention the main sections or key points that will be covered in your research paper.
- Clear research questionMost importantly, you need to present a clear research question and convince your readers that your work fills a gap in current knowledge ‚Äî if the readers do not believe that your paper will improve their understanding of the field in a meaningful way, they are less likely to invest valuable time and effort in reading it carefully [2].
- Purpose and Structure The structure and length of an Introduction are not set in stone and can vary across fields and publications [2].but this section ultimately serves a single purpose: to lead the reader through a narrative that ends with the presentation of the research and the reasons for its importance [2]. The ideal structure of such a narrative is a ‚Äúfunnel‚Äù that starts with broad conceptual information and gradually narrows in scope and specificity until the information presented is specific to the research questions being addressed [2]
-  Grab the Reader Draw them immediately to the crucial issue that your paper address. The Introduction to a research paper needs to convince the reader that your work is important and relevant, frame the questions being addressed, and provide context for the findings being presented.
-  Clearly State Your Contributions- Every research paper should have clearly defined contributions. These contributions should be explicit and laid out at the beginning of your introduction. Instead of leaving readers guessing, make a bullet-point list of what they can expect to gain from your paper. This not only clarifies your intentions but also sets the stage for the rest of your work. When formulating your contributions, ensure they are specific and refutable. Instead of making broad claims, provide statements that can be tested and validated through your research.
-  Keep it short 2-3 paragraphs if possible

 Example opening lines:

Despite advances in AI, interpretability remains a major challenge for real-world deployment.‚Äù
‚ÄúClimate change has intensified rainfall patterns, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.
-  

  ## Sections Structure of Introduction

  **Significance of Study**

-  Why is it important to undertake this research? Who will be the beneficiary(s)?
-  Justify how the proposed research will contribute to the industry/ national economy/ social sector.
-  Is the proposed research likely to promote further investigation within and/or across disciplines and fields?

  ## Tense

- **Present tense**: States known facts and current research, First, when stating a fact that is widely accepted, the present tense is appropriate. Present tense is used for now facts and truths and usually. Presents established facts, truths, and references from previous research. **Example:** "Many studies indicate that artificial intelligence has transformed healthcare."
- **Present Tense** ‚Üí General facts, accepted knowledge, or the paper's aim. **Example:** "Obesity is a global health issue affecting millions of people." Past Tense Specific prior studies and what their authors did or found. Example: "Smith (2020) found that diet interventions reduced weight significantly."
Methods

- Followed by the appropriate research reference Examples of such a statement include ‚ÄúDNA is composed of four nucleotides‚Äù or ‚Äútrypanosomes exhibit global trans-splicing of RNA transcripts.‚Äù The use of the present tense signifies that the statement reflects the current understanding of the matter at hand. Example: ‚ÄúClimate change is a critical global challenge.‚Äù

- Please note that the present tense is used when a specific, figure, or paper is the subject of a sentence. Similar to a movie or book, published research remains available readers to examine, a paper, therefore, continues to express its conclusions. Examples of statements about previous research using the present tense include ‚Äúthe of their study indicate the drug is highly effective‚Äù ‚Äúa landmark paper from Smith‚Äôs lab describes the discovery of this new organelle.‚Äù

- **Past tense:** Describes past work or experiments. Most introductions also include references to previous research. When referring to a previous study with results that are still relevant, use the present perfect tense (a form of the verb ‚Äòhave‚Äô plus a past participle, such as ‚Äúhave shown‚Äù or ‚Äúhas been shown‚Äù) .Example: "Smith et al. (2020) found that this method improved efficiency by 30%." This tense demonstrates that the action occurred in the past but still applies in the present. Phrases like ‚ÄúJohnson et al.have shown that gene X is part of an operon‚Äù or ‚Äúunusual glycosylation events have been observed in these cells‚Äù are appropriate because the research or observation was made in the past, but the results are still valid. This tense is also used when the event began in the past but continues in the present (‚Äúpatients with XYZ syndrome have been surveyed for the past ten years‚Äù).Example: ‚ÄúPrevious studies explored its impact on rainfall patterns.‚Äù

- Past tense is used for describing work or experiments that have been conducted and the result of these work

- In certain sections of an introduction, the past tense is required. When specifically referring to the methods used a previous paper, the past tense most appropriate. For instance, it is correct to say " and Anderson 96 swamps and found 156 distinct dragonfly species" or "gene X was first cloned into a shuttle vector 2003

- keep with the rule of good writing and is written using active rather than passive tense

- Statements that are no longer considered true should be kept in the past tense. ‚ÄúEarly physicists thought that electrons traveled in defined orbits.‚Äù

- Active voice: Emphasizes your contribution. Example: ‚ÄúWe address the gaps identified in prior research.‚Äù The active voice (for example using we or I) is useful when you discuss previous research and then introduce your own.Helpful for clarity in presenting past research and your work.
Example: "We conducted a detailed analysis to identify key trends.

- Passive voice: Avoid unless necessary. Example: ‚ÄúA comprehensive review was conducted.‚Äù The passive voice is not preferable for introduction but in some sentences passive voice can be perfectly acceptable. Less common but acceptable in some contexts. Example: "A thorou

  ## Reviewer Comments

-  Making the contribution and research objective clear
-  In the introduction section, the way of expressing the problem is not written correctly. The order of the introduction and the main purpose of the research should be written completely. In other parts of the article, the way of writing the method and the results are not followed and it is very ambiguous for the readers (even reviewers). There has been a repetition of the content.
-  The ideas discussed towards the end of the introduction section are not novel. In fact, they are already being implemented by many healthcare systems across the globe. The authors need to stress the novelty of their idea and moreover discuss the improvements compared to existing models
-  The novelty of this paper is not clear. The difference between the present work and previous Works should be highlighted
