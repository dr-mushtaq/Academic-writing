## **General Points** 

**Tense**

Below. The tense of a verb reflects the timing of the action. Choosing the correct verb tense for each section of a scientific manuscript can be challenging, but it is worth the effort. Editorials in several journals have noted that proper verb tense is an important aspect of a well-written manuscript, and some journals and publishers specifically mention verb tense in their style guides.
- **Past tense** indicates that action already occurred.
- **Present tense**: indicates that the action is currently occurring.
- **Future tense** indicates that the event has not yet occurred.
- **Future perfect tense**: in which the action is defined relative to another point in time
- **Active voice**: Use for clarity and ownership.
- **Passive voice**: Use sparingly for objectivity. process and transmit information.

**Writing**

- Avoid very long paragraphs and sentences
- consider using heading, bullets, italics, and boldface (But do not overuse these)
- Make easy-to-understand graphics
- Ensure that there is no disconnect in the flow of information from the title to the references.
- Avoiding inconsistency and vagueness
- **Start Writing Early**:One of the most significant misconceptions in academic writing is the belief that research should be completed before starting to write. In reality, initiating the writing process early can be incredibly beneficial. By beginning to write with a microscopic idea, you can clarify your thoughts and identify the research needed to support your claims. This approach allows you to focus on the essential components of your paper and can prevent you from veering off into irrelevant details.
- Writing early also facilitates discussions with colleagues. When you have a draft, even if it‚Äôs incomplete, you have something tangible to share and discuss. This collaborative effort can lead to new insights and improvements in your work.

**Editing**

- Before submitting your manuscript to a journal read the final version several times
- Seek feedback from others

**Identify Your Key Idea**

First discuss with seniors abroad and professors in your university about it. Understanding the core idea of your paper is crucial. The purpose of writing is to convey a reusable insight from your mind to that of your readers. It‚Äôs essential that by the end of your writing process, both you and your readers are clear about this key idea. Reviewers often highlight papers that lack clarity in this area, so make it a priority to articulate your main insight clearly.

If your work involves multiple ideas, consider separating them into different papers. Overloading a single paper with too many concepts can lead to confusion and dilute the impact of your primary message

**Choose some topic**

Then choose some topic, relevant to you , may be thesis
Download the papers relevant to the topic you chose. Any papers, review papers, novel, modifications etc are good.Download almost 30 or more papers read them. Not just read them but understand them. I know it takes time. But once you will start, you will get used to it.
While doing it, your mind will start making ideas, just start writing them somewhere. Again discuss with seniors, professors and friends after reading those papers. Then narrow down your topic further and download papers relevant to that topic again almost 20 or more papers or as many as you can find.

**Seek Feedback and Revise**

Feedback is an invaluable part of the writing process. Share your drafts with peers and encourage them to give constructive criticism, particularly regarding clarity and flow. It‚Äôs essential to ask them where they got lost or confused, as this information can guide your revisions. When you receive reviews on your submitted papers, approach them with an open mind. Even if the feedback stings, it‚Äôs crucial to see it as an opportunity for growth. Consider how you can refine your work based on the insights provided, striving for clarity that even a novice in your field can grasp.

## **Definition of Deep learning**

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that has gained significant attention in recent years due to its ability to tackle complex problems with large amounts of data. The motivation behind deep learning stems from the desire to replicate the human mind‚Äôs ability to learn and make decisions.

**Def:**  The term, Deep Learning, refers to training Neural Networks, sometimes very large Neural Networks.

**Def:** Deep learning refers to the process of involving a system that thinks and learns exactly like humans using an artificial neural network

**Def**: Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from data. the ‚Äúdeep‚Äù in deep learning refers to the depth of layers in a neural network. 

 **Def:**  A neural network of more than three layers, including the inputs and the output, can be considered a deep-learning algorithm. 

**Def:** Deep learning is a subcategory of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to process large amounts of data. It enables machines to learn complex patterns and make decisions based on this data.

**Def:** Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on building and training neural networks with multiple layers. These neural networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, with each layer processing and transforming data in a hierarchical manner. Deep learning algorithms learn from vast amounts of labeled data to make predictions or decisions.

## **Why use Deep Learning**

Deep learning is particularly effective for analyzing massive, complex data, such as images, videos or text. It excels in fields such as facial recognition, machine translation and autonomous driving.

## **Difference between Deep Learning and Machine Learning**

Deep learning and machine learning are both subfields of artificial intelligence (AI), but they differ significantly in their approach and capabilities. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of their key differences:

</p>


1. **Data Dependence**:

Machine Learning: Generally performs well with structured, labeled data. It requires features to be explicitly engineered by humans. While it can handle some unstructured data, its performance is often limited. 1, 2

Deep Learning: Thrives on large amounts of unstructured data. It automatically learns features from raw data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. This allows it to handle complex patterns and relationships that traditional machine learning struggles with. 1, 2

2. **Algorithm Complexity**:

Machine Learning: Employs relatively simpler algorithms. Examples include linear regression, support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees, and random forests. 3

Deep Learning: Uses complex, multi-layered artificial neural networks. These networks have many layers (hence ‚Äúdeep‚Äù), allowing them to learn intricate hierarchical representations of data. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data are prime examples. 3

3. **Feature Extraction**:

Machine Learning: Requires manual feature extraction. Data scientists must carefully select and engineer relevant features from the raw data before training the model. This is a time-consuming and often challenging process. 4

Deep Learning: Automatically learns features through multiple layers of the neural network. This eliminates the need for manual feature engineering, making it more efficient for complex data. 4

4. **Computational Power**:

Machine Learning: Can often be trained on relatively modest computational resources.

Deep Learning: Demands significantly more computational power due to the complexity of its algorithms and the large datasets it processes. This often requires specialized hardware like GPUs or TPUs. 5

5. **Interpretability**:

Machine Learning: Generally more interpretable. It‚Äôs often easier to understand how a simpler machine learning model arrives at its predictions.

Deep Learning: Often considered a ‚Äúblack box.‚Äù The intricate workings of deep neural networks can be difficult to interpret, making it challenging to understand why a model makes a specific prediction. 4

In short: Deep learning is a specialized subset of machine learning. Machine learning is suitable for simpler tasks with structured data, while deep learning excels at complex tasks with large amounts of unstructured data, but requires significantly more computational resources. The choice between them depends on the specific problem and available resources.
