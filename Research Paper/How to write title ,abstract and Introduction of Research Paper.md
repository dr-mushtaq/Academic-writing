
# Description:

Before embarking on your research paper writing journey, it is crucial to have a clear understanding of the structure and format that you should follow. The typical research paper structure consists of the following sections:

## üìë Table of Contents  

- [Title](#Title)  
- [Definition of Deep Learning](#definition-of-deep-learning)  
- [Why use Deep Learning](#Why-use-Deep-Learning)  
- [Difference between Deep Learning and Machine Learning](#Difference-between-Deep-Learning-and-Machine-Learning)  
- [Applications](#applications)  


# **Title** 
The title should be concise, informative, and catch the reader‚Äôs attention.

**Tense**
- For many journals, the manuscript title does not need to be a complete sentence, and no verb is necessary .
- In cases where a complete sentence is appropriate, use the simple present tense to describe a conclusion that the manuscript supports (e.g., ‚ÄúGene X is required for intestinal cell differentiation‚Äù or ‚ÄúFrameshift mutations in gene X cause abnormal notochord development in zebrafish‚Äù).


**Writing**

- A Good title should contain the fewest possible words that adequately describe the content of the paper
- Keep title short
- Title identify the main issue of the paper
- Title begin with the subject of the paper
- Title Do not contain infrequently used abbreviations
- Make them easy for indexing and searching informative attractive, effective
- Keep the title simple and Specific to describe the content but not so technical it cannot be easily understood, Try to be concise

## **Why your abstract is important**

5 reasons why your abstract is important

- The abstract provides a quick overview: The abstract is the first section of a scientific paper that readers encounter. Therefore, it should provide a brief overview of the entire paper, including your key findings
- A well-written abstract increases accessibility and visibility: Abstracts are often published in databases and indexes which allows researchers to search for papers based on specific keywords in search engines such as Google Scholar, the Web of Science Master Journal List, or PubMed.
- Abstracts save researchers and journal editors time: Researchers often need to read through many papers to find the information they need. The abstract allows readers to quickly determine if a paper is relevant to their needs, saving them time and effort.
- An abstract can improve understanding: The abstract summarizes the key findings and conclusions of the research. This enables readers to quickly understand the implications of the research and its potential impact on their field.
- An abstract enables critical appraisal: This allows readers to evaluate the quality and reliability of the research and determine if the conclusions are supported by the evidence presented.
