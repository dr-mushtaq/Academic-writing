
# Description:

Before embarking on your research paper writing journey, it is crucial to have a clear understanding of the structure and format that you should follow. The typical research paper structure consists of the following sections:

## üìë Table of Contents  

- [Title](#Title)  
- [Abstract](#Abstract)  


# **Title** 
The title should be concise, informative, and catch the reader‚Äôs attention.

**Tense**
- For many journals, the manuscript title does not need to be a complete sentence, and no verb is necessary .
- In cases where a complete sentence is appropriate, use the simple present tense to describe a conclusion that the manuscript supports (e.g., ‚ÄúGene X is required for intestinal cell differentiation‚Äù or ‚ÄúFrameshift mutations in gene X cause abnormal notochord development in zebrafish‚Äù).


**Writing**

- A Good title should contain the fewest possible words that adequately describe the content of the paper
- Keep title short
- Title identify the main issue of the paper
- Title begin with the subject of the paper
- Title Do not contain infrequently used abbreviations
- Make them easy for indexing and searching informative attractive, effective
- Keep the title simple and Specific to describe the content but not so technical it cannot be easily understood, Try to be concise
- Titel should be under 20 words long

**Reviwer Comments**

- To aid our readers, and to maximize the accessibility of your manuscript, the title should have a clear, precise scientific meaning without unnecessary punctuations (e.g. without colon, -, question mark). Where possible, the title should be read as one concise sentence which is under 20 words long. Please could you re-write the title ensuring that it is informative and appropriate. Please ensure title change is made in all respective file where title has been given.

# Abstract 

A brief summary of the research paper, highlighting its objectives, methods, key findings, and conclusions.

## **Why your abstract is important**

5 reasons why your abstract is important

- The abstract provides a quick overview: The abstract is the first section of a scientific paper that readers encounter. Therefore, it should provide a brief overview of the entire paper, including your key findings
- A well-written abstract increases accessibility and visibility: Abstracts are often published in databases and indexes which allows researchers to search for papers based on specific keywords in search engines such as Google Scholar, the Web of Science Master Journal List, or PubMed.
- Abstracts save researchers and journal editors time: Researchers often need to read through many papers to find the information they need. The abstract allows readers to quickly determine if a paper is relevant to their needs, saving them time and effort.
- An abstract can improve understanding: The abstract summarizes the key findings and conclusions of the research. This enables readers to quickly understand the implications of the research and its potential impact on their field.
- An abstract enables critical appraisal: This allows readers to evaluate the quality and reliability of the research and determine if the conclusions are supported by the evidence presented.

## Type of Abstract

Here's a quick guide to the types of abstracts:

**1. Descriptive Abstracts:**

A brief snapshot of your study, think "teaser trailer." It mentions the purpose, methods, scope but skips results and conclusions.

**2. Informative Abstracts:**

The whole story in a nutshell. Covers purpose, methods, key findings and conclusions.

**3. Critical Abstracts:**

Adds a layer of evaluation or critique. Great for papers where interpretation matters as much as results.

**4. Structured Abstracts:**

Divided into sections like Objective, Methods, Results and Conclusion. Perfect for systematic reviews, clinical studies and scientific journals.

**5. Graphical Abstracts:**

A visual representation of your research. These abstracts use diagrams, flowcharts or infographics to summarize your study at a glance.
Ideal for visually communicating complex findings or attracting attention in journals with broad audiences.

## Tips for Writing a Winning Abstract

-  State the why behind your research in one clear sentence.
-  Mention the problem or question you‚Äôre addressing. It shows your study's relevance.
- kip the fluff! Include only the most impactful findings.
- abstracts are 250-300 words. Make every word count. Be Concise, Yet Complete.
-  Stick to Journal Guidelines: Different journals or conferences have specific formats. Don‚Äôt miss this!
- ise, Revise, Revise: Treat your abstract like a mini research paper. Proofread for clarity, flow and accuracy.
- Introduction/ Background: Briefly introduce the topic and the research problem.
- Objectives: Clearly state the primary objective(s) of the research
- Methods: Summarize the research design and methodology.
- Results: Highlight the main findings of the research.
- Conclusions: Provide the main conclusions and the implications of the study
- Honest and precise
- can standalone (search engines, sometimes all people read)
- No technical jargon
- Short and Specific
- Cites no references
- The abstract is short but remember not to cram as much detail into it as possible; you want to grab the reader‚Äôs attention with the first statement

  ## Tense
  
- The verb tense chosen for the abstract should be based on the section of the text to which each sentence corresponds. For example, introductory statements describing the current understanding of the issue should use the present tense, references to previous research should use the present perfect, and descriptions of the methods and results should use the past tense.
- Present tense is used for highlighting the gaps the aim and objective of and the application. Example ‚ÄúThis study examines the effects of climate change on agriculture.‚Äù
- Past Tense: Summarizes the methods used and key findings of the study. Example: "Data was collected through surveys and analyzed using SPSS."
- Past tense: Summarizes methodology and key results. Example: ‚ÄúThe data were collected using satellite imagery.
- Past Perfect Tense: Highlights achievements. Example: "The team had successfully developed a new algorithm for data processing.

  ## Reviewer Comments

  - The abstract must mention the results in terms of statistically explicitly
  - the keywords mentioned in the abstract were not reflected in the abstract.
  - The author needs to change the abstract and focus more on the problem domain. Before the paper contributions, the author could precisely include the need of developing the proposed method.

#  Introduction  

This section provides an overview of the research topic, presents the research question or hypothesis, and outlines the significance and relevance of the study. The introduction sets the stage for your research paper and should captivate the reader‚Äôs interest while providing essential background information.

The introduction of your paper is your first opportunity to engage your readers. It should clearly outline the problem at hand, why it matters, and what your contributions will be. Avoid vague statements; instead, provide concrete examples and a clear roadmap of what the reader can expect.

## Structure of Introduction

1Ô∏è‚É£ Paragraph 1: What is the paper about and why is it important? By the end of the first paragraph, readers should know your answers to these questions. Although you may see advice to start with the general topic and use a "reverse funnel" outline, that can lead to long, meandering introductions. If you are starting with, "Creativity is increasingly important in work today," you are probably starting too generally. Try starting as close to your research question or phenomenon as you can. Two common approaches are (a) start with a real-world example of the phenomenon you are studying or (b) start with a question about the phenomenon (e.g., How do leaders know when to intervene to help their teams?).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Paragraph 2: What has research already found about this phenomenon? As I wrote in a prior post, this is your chance to characterize the literature. Start the paragraph with the point you want to make, e.g., "Despite its importance, research on listening in organizations remains fragmented" (from Yip & Fisher, 2022). Then, back up your assertion. But be careful not to get too technical; avoid jargon unless it is essential. Try to confine this description of the literature to 4-6 sentences.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Paragraph 3: What unsolved issues are there that research has not yet addressed, or has addressed in fragmented or contradictory ways? Why is that an important problem? The last question is commonly overlooked - what are the consequences of never solving this problem? What might we mis-explain or predict -- and why would that be so terrible?

4Ô∏è‚É£ Paragraph 4: What is this paper going to do to solve that problem? Here, you can give an overview of the paper, including its main hypotheses (e.g., "We develop and test hypotheses..."), methods, and contributions.

## Tips for writing an effective introduction

- The introduction should introduce the topic of the paper, provide background information, and state the thesis statement.
- Investing time in crafting a strong introduction can significantly improve the likelihood of your paper being read in its entirety. Remember, many readers will drop off after the first page, so make those words count.
- When writing the introduction pick out the things that are most relevant to your work and explain why. Present the background of your work while focusing on the most important issues.this section aims to provide the relevant background and rationale for your work, as well as specify its novelty and contribution;
- Hook the reader: Begin with an attention-grabbing opening sentence or anecdote that relates to your research topic.
- Provide context: Introduce the research topic and its significance in a broader context, highlighting any relevant background information or previous studies.
- State the research question or hypothesis: Clearly articulate your main research question or hypothesis to guide the reader throughout the paper.
- Outline the paper‚Äôs structure: Briefly mention the main sections or key points that will be covered in your research paper.
