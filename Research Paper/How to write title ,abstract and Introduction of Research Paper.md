Before embarking on your research paper writing journey, it is crucial to have a clear understanding of the structure and format that you should follow. The typical research paper structure consists of the following sections:

## üìë Table of Contents  

- [Title](#Title)  
- [Definition of Deep Learning](#definition-of-deep-learning)  
- [Why use Deep Learning](#Why-use-Deep-Learning)  
- [Difference between Deep Learning and Machine Learning](#Difference-between-Deep-Learning-and-Machine-Learning)  
- [Applications](#applications)  


## **Title** 
The title should be concise, informative, and catch the reader‚Äôs attention.

**Tense**
- For many journals, the manuscript title does not need to be a complete sentence, and no verb is necessary .
- In cases where a complete sentence is appropriate, use the simple present tense to describe a conclusion that the manuscript supports (e.g., ‚ÄúGene X is required for intestinal cell differentiation‚Äù or ‚ÄúFrameshift mutations in gene X cause abnormal notochord development in zebrafish‚Äù).


**Writing**

- A Good title should contain the fewest possible words that adequately describe the content of the paper
- Keep title short
- identify the main issue of the paper
- begin with the subject of the paper

are accurate, unambiguous specific, and complete

Do not contain infrequently-used abbreviations

Make them easy for indexing and searching informative attractive, effective

Keep the title simple and Specific to describe the content but not so technical it cannot be easily understood, Try to be concise
**Editing**

- Before submitting your manuscript to a journal read the final version several times
- Seek feedback from others

**Identify Your Key Idea**

First discuss with seniors abroad and professors in your university about it. Understanding the core idea of your paper is crucial. The purpose of writing is to convey a reusable insight from your mind to that of your readers. It‚Äôs essential that by the end of your writing process, both you and your readers are clear about this key idea. Reviewers often highlight papers that lack clarity in this area, so make it a priority to articulate your main insight clearly.

If your work involves multiple ideas, consider separating them into different papers. Overloading a single paper with too many concepts can lead to confusion and dilute the impact of your primary message

**Choose some topic**

Then choose some topic, relevant to you , may be thesis
Download the papers relevant to the topic you chose. Any papers, review papers, novel, modifications etc are good.Download almost 30 or more papers read them. Not just read them but understand them. I know it takes time. But once you will start, you will get used to it.
While doing it, your mind will start making ideas, just start writing them somewhere. Again discuss with seniors, professors and friends after reading those papers. Then narrow down your topic further and download papers relevant to that topic again almost 20 or more papers or as many as you can find.

**Narrowed down topic**

When you read all papers in your narrowed down topic, your mind would have already started making ideas about any of these things that are required for every paper to publish Novelty, Modifications, Improvement, product
So you will work on any of those ideas by thinking new novel method. Or will combine many methods that you have read in papers or use any method that you read to improve some already used method. So any of the combinations, you can try. If you dun have any idea, you can use all the papers that you have read on specific topic to make a review paper. But review paper should include all the work that have been presented about that topic before in a good and concise way

**Seek Feedback and Revise**

Feedback is an invaluable part of the writing process. Share your drafts with peers and encourage them to give constructive criticism, particularly regarding clarity and flow. It‚Äôs essential to ask them where they got lost or confused, as this information can guide your revisions. When you receive reviews on your submitted papers, approach them with an open mind. Even if the feedback stings, it‚Äôs crucial to see it as an opportunity for growth. Consider how you can refine your work based on the insights provided, striving for clarity that even a novice in your field can grasp.
