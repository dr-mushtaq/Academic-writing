# What is a literature review?

A literature review is more than just a summary of research papers. It’s a critical analysis of everything that’s been published about your topic — showing what’s known, what’s missing, and how your work fills that gap.

In simple terms, your literature review proves that you’ve done your homework. It explains how your study fits into the broader research landscape and why it matters.
A comprehensive review of existing scholarly literature related to the research topic, highlighting the gaps or limitations that your study aims to address. The literature review demonstrates your understanding of existing scholarship on your research topic and highlights the gaps or limitations that your study aims to address.
A literature review is a critical examination of information relevant to your proposed research topic. It involves analysing and evaluating the work of a range of scholars in relation to your research topic.
A literature review includes paraphrases, quotes and your critique of authors whose works you have read. Reviewing the literature will help you identify your research question and the gap in your field that you can explore.

# How to start a literature review?

**Identify themes and key areas**.

Start by finding common threads across research papers — such as methods, findings, or theories — and use them as subheadings

**Keep detailed notes**

Create an annotated bibliography where you summarize, quote, and paraphrase key ideas.

**Color-code your notes**.
Use colors or tags for different themes. This makes it easier to group similar studies later.

Pro tip: Tools like Zotero, Mendeley, or Notion can help organize references efficiently.
- When taking notes, reference as you go and create an annotated bibliography. This means you summarise the key ideas, type out any quotes and paraphrase where you can.
- Colour code these notes based on themes, to help you cut and paste them into the literature review.

 # 🧩 What to Ask When Reading Research Papers
 
 Before adding a paper to your literature review, ask yourself:
- How relevant is this to my topic?
- Does it add something new to the field?
- Is the argument well-supported by data?
- How does it compare with other scholars’ views?
- Can its methods or theories be applied to my own work?
- Which topics or perspectives are still missing?
These questions help you think critically rather than just summarizing existing studies.
-  How is this relevant to your research? 
-  How does it contribute to your field?
-  What is the main argument?
-  How reliable is this source?
-  How strong is the evidence provided?
-  How are the views expressed similar or different to other scholars?
-  Can the theoretical approaches/methods be applied to your research?
-  Who are the key scholars in your field? •
-  What topics have ben overlooked?

  # 🌟 Why a Literature Review Matters

- A well-written literature review:
- Clarifies your research questions
- Establishes the context for your study
- Prevents unintentional plagiarism
- Helps you identify weaknesses in existing work
- Builds credibility for your findings
- In short, it connects your research to the bigger picture.

  # 🧠 Key Guidelines for Writing an Effective Literature Review

- Start broad, then narrow down. Begin with a general overview and move toward specific studies that closely relate to your research question.
- Organize logically. Use thematic or chronological structures.
- Be critical, not just descriptive. Highlight what each study contributes — and what it misses.
- Show the gap. Make it clear where your research fits in.
Update continuously. Literature review isn’t a one-time step — it evolves as you keep reading and refining your study.


  # Reviewer Comments

- The related work section seems to be just an informatory section where various related works are discussed. All the discussion presented in this section lacks critical analysis. Authors need to look at this aspect of the related work as well and need to improve on it.
- The author could better explain how “Related Works” is actually related to the current study. It is not clear to the reader how the manuscript is similar to or differs from these related works.
  
# 📝 Final Thoughts and Call-to-Action

Writing a literature review takes time, but it’s one of the most rewarding parts of research. You’re not just summarizing others — you’re mapping the knowledge landscape.
