# What is a literature review?

A literature review is more than just a summary of research papers. It’s a critical analysis of everything that’s been published about your topic — showing what’s known, what’s missing, and how your work fills that gap.

In simple terms, your literature review proves that you’ve done your homework. It explains how your study fits into the broader research landscape and why it matters.
A comprehensive review of existing scholarly literature related to the research topic, highlighting the gaps or limitations that your study aims to address. The literature review demonstrates your understanding of existing scholarship on your research topic and highlights the gaps or limitations that your study aims to address.
A literature review is a critical examination of information relevant to your proposed research topic. It involves analysing and evaluating the work of a range of scholars in relation to your research topic.
A literature review includes paraphrases, quotes and your critique of authors whose works you have read. Reviewing the literature will help you identify your research question and the gap in your field that you can explore.

# How to start a literature review?

**Identify themes and key areas**.

Start by finding common threads across research papers — such as methods, findings, or theories — and use them as subheadings

**Keep detailed notes**

Create an annotated bibliography where you summarize, quote, and paraphrase key ideas.

**Color-code your notes**.
Use colors or tags for different themes. This makes it easier to group similar studies later.

Pro tip: Tools like Zotero, Mendeley, or Notion can help organize references efficiently.
- When taking notes, reference as you go and create an annotated bibliography. This means you summarise the key ideas, type out any quotes and paraphrase where you can.
- Colour code these notes based on themes, to help you cut and paste them into the literature review.

 #  What to Ask When Reading Research Papers
 
 Before adding a paper to your literature review, ask yourself:
- How relevant is this to my topic?
- Does it add something new to the field?
- Is the argument well-supported by data?
- How does it compare with other scholars’ views?
- Can its methods or theories be applied to my own work?
- Which topics or perspectives are still missing?
These questions help you think critically rather than just summarizing existing studies.
-  How is this relevant to your research? 
-  How does it contribute to your field?
-  What is the main argument?
-  How reliable is this source?
-  How strong is the evidence provided?
-  How are the views expressed similar or different to other scholars?
-  Can the theoretical approaches/methods be applied to your research?
-  Who are the key scholars in your field? •
-  What topics have ben overlooked?
-
 # What is the main purpose of the literature Review
 
  - Show relatioships between previous studies or theories
  - Find out what information already exists in your field of research
  - Identify gaps in literature
  - Provide a context for your own research
  - Find other people working in your field
  - Identify main ideas, conclusions and theories and establish similarities and differences
  - Identify main methodologies and research techniques
  - Identify major seminal works

  # Why a Literature Review Matters

- A well-written literature review:
- Clarifies your research questions
- Establishes the context for your study
- Prevents unintentional plagiarism
- Helps you identify weaknesses in existing work
- Builds credibility for your findings
- In short, it connects your research to the bigger picture.

 # 🧠 Key Guidelines for Writing an Effective Literature Review

Writing a strong 𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄 is about more than summarising sources—it shows what is known, what is debated, and where your study fits. Below is 𝗮 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿, 𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗽-𝗯𝘆-𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝗴𝘂𝗶𝗱𝗲,   𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗿𝗲𝗱 for postgraduate and PhD-level work.

**𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻**
  
 - Introduce the topic
 - Explain the scope and organisation of the review
 - Clarify the focus of the chapter

**𝗕𝗼𝗱𝘆 (𝗦𝘆𝗻𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗶𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗖𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗾𝘂𝗲)**

For each theme:
 - Discuss 𝗸𝗲𝘆 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀
 - Compare and contrast studies
 - Highlight 𝗮𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀, 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗱𝗶𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗮𝗽𝘀
 -  Critically evaluate methods and theories

 ✍️ Example synthesis sentence:
𝘞𝘩𝘪𝘭𝘦 𝘴𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘭 𝘴𝘵𝘶𝘥𝘪𝘦𝘴 (𝘈; 𝘉; 𝘊) 𝘳𝘦𝘱𝘰𝘳𝘵 𝘢 𝘱𝘰𝘴𝘪𝘵𝘪𝘷𝘦 𝘳𝘦𝘭𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘴𝘩𝘪𝘱 𝘣𝘦𝘵𝘸𝘦𝘦𝘯 𝘟 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘠, 𝘰𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘴 (𝘋; 𝘌) 𝘲𝘶𝘦𝘴𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘬, 𝘤𝘪𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘮𝘦𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘥𝘰𝘭𝘰𝘨𝘪𝘤𝘢𝘭 𝘭𝘪𝘮𝘪𝘵𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘴.

**𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵 𝗚𝗮𝗽 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗝𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻**

 - Clearly show 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗺𝗶𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴
 - Explain 𝘄𝗵𝘆 𝗶𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀
 -  Link the gap directly to 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘀𝘁𝘂𝗱𝘆

 **𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗼𝗻 𝗠𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗸𝗲𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗔𝘃𝗼𝗶𝗱 ❌**
 
 - Listing studies one by one
 - Ignoring contradictions in the literature
 - Using outdated or non-academic sources
 - Failing to link the literature to your research problem
 

- Start broad, then narrow down. Begin with a general overview and move toward specific studies that closely relate to your research question.
- Organize logically. Use thematic or chronological structures.
- Be critical, not just descriptive. Highlight what each study contributes — and what it misses.
- Show the gap. Make it clear where your research fits in.
Update continuously. Literature review isn’t a one-time step — it evolves as you keep reading and refining your study.

**Final Tip**

A strong literature review answers three questions:

- 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗱𝗼 𝘄𝗲 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄?
- 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗱𝗼𝗻’𝘁 𝘄𝗲 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄?
- 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝘀𝘁𝘂𝗱𝘆 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗯𝘂𝘁𝗲?


  # Reviewer Comments

- The related work section seems to be just an informatory section where various related works are discussed. All the discussion presented in this section lacks critical analysis. Authors need to look at this aspect of the related work as well and need to improve on it.
- The author could better explain how “Related Works” is actually related to the current study. It is not clear to the reader how the manuscript is similar to or differs from these related works.

 # ChatGPT prompt for literature review
