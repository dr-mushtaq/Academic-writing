# What is a literature review?

A literature review is more than just a summary of research papers. It‚Äôs a critical analysis of everything that‚Äôs been published about your topic ‚Äî showing what‚Äôs known, what‚Äôs missing, and how your work fills that gap.

In simple terms, your literature review proves that you‚Äôve done your homework. It explains how your study fits into the broader research landscape and why it matters.
A comprehensive review of existing scholarly literature related to the research topic, highlighting the gaps or limitations that your study aims to address. The literature review demonstrates your understanding of existing scholarship on your research topic and highlights the gaps or limitations that your study aims to address.
A literature review is a critical examination of information relevant to your proposed research topic. It involves analysing and evaluating the work of a range of scholars in relation to your research topic.
A literature review includes paraphrases, quotes and your critique of authors whose works you have read. Reviewing the literature will help you identify your research question and the gap in your field that you can explore.

# How to start a literature review?

**Identify themes and key areas**.

Start by finding common threads across research papers ‚Äî such as methods, findings, or theories ‚Äî and use them as subheadings

**Keep detailed notes**

Create an annotated bibliography where you summarize, quote, and paraphrase key ideas.

**Color-code your notes**.
Use colors or tags for different themes. This makes it easier to group similar studies later.

Pro tip: Tools like Zotero, Mendeley, or Notion can help organize references efficiently.
- When taking notes, reference as you go and create an annotated bibliography. This means you summarise the key ideas, type out any quotes and paraphrase where you can.
- Colour code these notes based on themes, to help you cut and paste them into the literature review.

 # What you should consider when reading a paper/book
-  How is this relevant to your research? 
-  How does it contribute to your field?
-  What is the main argument?
-  How reliable is this source?
-  How strong is the evidence provided?
-  How are the views expressed similar or different to other scholars?
-  Can the theoretical approaches/methods be applied to your research?
-  Who are the key scholars in your field? ‚Ä¢
-  What topics have ben overlooked?

  # Importance of Literature review 
- it helps clarity research questions
- it helps establish a context for research
- It helps you avoids incidental plagiarism
- it support your own finding
- It helps assess the quality of previous research
- it helps to identify problem

  # ‚úÖ Key Guidelines

- Start broad, then narrow down: Begin by providing an overview of the broader field or topic area before gradually narrowing down to more specific studies relevant to your research question.
- Organize by themes or chronologically: Structure your literature review either thematically (grouping studies based on common themes) or chronologically (highlighting how the field has evolved over time).
- Critically analyze sources: Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each source and identify any contradictory findings or gaps in existing literature.
-  Highlight key findings: Summarize the main arguments or findings from each study and discuss how they contribute to your research objectives.
-  The literature review should discuss the research that has been done on the topic. This will help you to establish the context for your paper and to identify the gaps in the research.
-  What is known /What all has been done by others in the past related to your field , What has been the strength and weaknesses of the previous related researchers Why is your research is still necessary A literature review is a continuous process from day one to the day your start research. AS You read every day for literature review, fill up your literature review Matrix, it is good to be a daily process. Eventually, a pattern will emerge for the research Gap. There are different type of research Gap and their details as follows
-  Position Related Work Appropriately- Many papers start with an extensive review of related work, which can be overwhelming and often disengaging for readers. Instead, consider placing this section at the end of your paper. By that time, your readers will have the necessary context to appreciate how your work fits into the broader landscape of the field. When you do reference related work, ensure it serves to highlight your contributions rather than detract from them.




  ## Reviewer Comments

- The related work section seems to be just an informatory section where various related works are discussed. All the discussion presented in this section lacks critical analysis. Authors need to look at this aspect of the related work as well and need to improve on it.
- The author could better explain how ‚ÄúRelated Works‚Äù is actually related to the current study. It is not clear to the reader how the manuscript is similar to or differs from these related works.
