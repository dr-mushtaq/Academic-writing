# What is a literature review?

A literature review is more than just a summary of research papers. It’s a critical analysis of everything that’s been published about your topic — showing what’s known, what’s missing, and how your work fills that gap.

In simple terms, your literature review proves that you’ve done your homework. It explains how your study fits into the broader research landscape and why it matters.
A comprehensive review of existing scholarly literature related to the research topic, highlighting the gaps or limitations that your study aims to address. The literature review demonstrates your understanding of existing scholarship on your research topic and highlights the gaps or limitations that your study aims to address.
A literature review is a critical examination of information relevant to your proposed research topic. It involves analysing and evaluating the work of a range of scholars in relation to your research topic.
A literature review includes paraphrases, quotes and your critique of authors whose works you have read. Reviewing the literature will help you identify your research question and the gap in your field that you can explore.

# How to start a literature review?

**Identify themes and key areas**.

Start by finding common threads across research papers — such as methods, findings, or theories — and use them as subheadings

**Keep detailed notes**

Create an annotated bibliography where you summarize, quote, and paraphrase key ideas.

**Color-code your notes**.
Use colors or tags for different themes. This makes it easier to group similar studies later.

Pro tip: Tools like Zotero, Mendeley, or Notion can help organize references efficiently.
- When taking notes, reference as you go and create an annotated bibliography. This means you summarise the key ideas, type out any quotes and paraphrase where you can.
- Colour code these notes based on themes, to help you cut and paste them into the literature review.

 #  What to Ask When Reading Research Papers
 
 Before adding a paper to your literature review, ask yourself:
- How relevant is this to my topic?
- Does it add something new to the field?
- Is the argument well-supported by data?
- How does it compare with other scholars’ views?
- Can its methods or theories be applied to my own work?
- Which topics or perspectives are still missing?
These questions help you think critically rather than just summarizing existing studies.
-  How is this relevant to your research? 
-  How does it contribute to your field?
-  What is the main argument?
-  How reliable is this source?
-  How strong is the evidence provided?
-  How are the views expressed similar or different to other scholars?
-  Can the theoretical approaches/methods be applied to your research?
-  Who are the key scholars in your field? •
-  What topics have ben overlooked?

 # What is the main purpose of the literature Review
 
  - Show relatioships between previous studies or theories
  - Find out what information already exists in your field of research
  - Identify gaps in literature
  - Provide a context for your own research
  - Find other people working in your field
  - Identify main ideas, conclusions and theories and establish similarities and differences
  - Identify main methodologies and research techniques
  - Identify major seminal works

  # Why a Literature Review Matters

- A well-written literature review:
- Clarifies your research questions
- Establishes the context for your study
- Prevents unintentional plagiarism
- Helps you identify weaknesses in existing work
- Builds credibility for your findings
- In short, it connects your research to the bigger picture.

  # 🧠 Key Guidelines for Writing an Effective Literature Review

- Start broad, then narrow down. Begin with a general overview and move toward specific studies that closely relate to your research question.
- Organize logically. Use thematic or chronological structures.
- Be critical, not just descriptive. Highlight what each study contributes — and what it misses.
- Show the gap. Make it clear where your research fits in.
Update continuously. Literature review isn’t a one-time step — it evolves as you keep reading and refining your study.


  # Reviewer Comments

- The related work section seems to be just an informatory section where various related works are discussed. All the discussion presented in this section lacks critical analysis. Authors need to look at this aspect of the related work as well and need to improve on it.
- The author could better explain how “Related Works” is actually related to the current study. It is not clear to the reader how the manuscript is similar to or differs from these related works.

 # ChatGPT prompt for literature review

## Prompt 1

"You are my academic research assistant specializing in literature review writing. Your task is to help me write a critical, synthesis-driven review of the literature on [insert topic]. Follow this structure:
1. Mapping the field - summarize major themes, theories, and methodologies.
2. Clustering sources - group studies by theme,
chronology, method, or theory.
3. Critical synthesis - highlight agreements, contradictions, and limitations.
4. Research gaps - show what's underexplored and where future research could contribute.
5. Recommendations - suggest key authors, seminal works, and journals to explore.
6. Important: Base all responses only on verifiable, peer- reviewed, and reputable scholarly sources. Avoid assumptions, non-academic claims, or spurious works.
7. Guidelines: Write in an academic, analytical tone (no descriptive lists!), use smooth transitions, and balance landmark works with recent contributions."

# Literature Review Note-taking Template

- Author Last Name, Article title Journal name (Publication year)
-
   **Research Question**
   
  -  Look at the end of the article's Introduction:
 -  Write a one-sentence summary of the article's research question. If the article gives a hypothesis, write a one-sentence summary of that too.

 **Motivation**
  
- Look at the beginning of the article's Introduction:
- Write a one-sentence summary of the social motivation. How will the article solve social, environmental, or other problems?
Look in the Background/Literature Review:
⚫ Write a one sentence summary of the research gap. How will the article fill a lack of knowledge in the literature?
Results
Look in the Results & Discussion, especially the figures, tables, and subsection headers:
⚫ Write a one-sentence summary of the main finding. What finding directly answers the research question?
⚫ Write a one-sentence summary of each supplementary finding. What context do these supplementary findings add to the main finding? Copy and paste any relevant figures and/or tables.
Methods
Look in the Methods:
• Write a one-paragraph summary of the
experimental methods. Describe each stage of the experiment, how those stages interact, what inputs they require, and what outputs they generate.
Draw a flowchart showing the flow of data between these different stages.
Impressions
Answer the following questions:
• What was good about this article?
• What questions do you have about the methods, findings, and conclusions?
What are this study's weaknesses?
How might this study be improved?
