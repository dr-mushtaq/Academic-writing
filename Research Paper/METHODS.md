# What is Research Methodology?

Def: Describe tools/ techniques/ data instruments and design to be used for analyzing and validating the research work

Def: Methodology section describes the research design, sample size, data collection methods, and analysis techniques employed in your study. The methodology section outlines how you conducted your research, including details about sample selection, data collection methods, and data analysis techniques.

Def: This section provides all the methodologies details necessary for another scientist to duplicate your work.

Def: This section aims to provide details of your methodological approach to your research and data analysis; What to do and how to solve the problem, Which research method (Survey, modeling, cases study ) will be used Type of data and its source should be briefed, Time duration of your research Total cost of incurred on your research



# Guidline for writing Methodology Section ?
Here are some guidelines for presenting methodology

- It should be a narrative of the steps you took in your experiment or study not a list of instructions such as you might find in a cookbook. An 
important part of writing a scientific paper is deciding what bit of information needs to be given in detail.
- Do not quote or cite your laboratory manual. Sometimes experimental details are given as a supplement.
- The methods section should describe how you conducted your research. This could include information about the data that you collected, the methods that you used to analyze the data, and the limitations of your research.
- Describe tools/ techniques/ data instruments and design to be used for analyzing and validating the research work
- Provide clear descriptions: Clearly explain the steps you took to collect data and analyze it so that other researchers can replicate your study if needed.

# Tense

- The methods section should use the **past tense** because it is a report of what was done during the course of the study ,‚Äù we tested independently derived cultures for resistance to trimethoprim‚Äù.
- When one action occurred before another, the **past perfect tense** can be used to indicate the earlier action, with the subsequent action in the **simple past tense**. The past perfect tense is formed by combining the word ‚Äòhad‚Äô with the past participle (typically the ‚Äò-ed‚Äô or ‚Äò-en‚Äô form) of a verb.
- Examples combining the past and past perfect tenses include ‚Äúthe cells that had been irradiated [past perfect] were assayed [past] for DNA damage‚Äù and ‚Äúpatients who had elected [past perfect] to undergo surgery completed [past] questionnaires.‚Äù





# Types of Research Gap

| **Research Gap**           | **Definition**                                 | **Example**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Evidence Gap**            | Lack of empirical data                        | Limited data on long-term mental health benefits of telemedicine for elderly patients. |
| **Knowledge Gap**           | Lack of theoretical understanding             | No solid framework explaining why mobile apps improve diabetic health outcomes. |
| **Practical-Knowledge Gap** | Theory-practice disconnect                    | VR therapy is effective for pain management but rarely implemented in hospitals. |
| **Population Gap**          | Certain groups overlooked                     | Hypertension research focused on urban, neglects rural populations. |
| **Methodological Gap**      | Need for improved methods                     | Relying on self-reports instead of wearables for dietary data in chronic disease patients. |
| **Theoretical Gap**         | Lack of unified theory                        | No comprehensive model explaining chronic pain intervention effectiveness. |
| **Geographical Gap**        | Regionally limited research                   | COVID-19 vaccine studies focused on high-income countries, limited studies in low-income regions. |
| **Empirical Gap**           | Unexplored variable interactions              | Lack of empirical studies linking stress levels to cancer recovery rates. |
| **Conceptual Gap**          | Underdeveloped concept or idea                | Undefined framework for ‚Äúpersonalized treatments‚Äù in precision medicine. |
| **Temporal Gap**            | Lack of time-based follow-up research         | Initial telehealth studies during COVID-19 need longitudinal follow-up. |

# How to Identigy Research Gap
## Review Existing Literature
- Use reliable databases like PubMed, Scopus, or Google Scholar to find peer- reviewed articles.
- Focus on recent studies to ensure you understand the latest developments in your field.
- Look for patterns, trends, and limitations in the studies you read.
- Identify recurring themes, unanswered questions, or areas of controversy.
- Look for gaps in knowledge, conflicting findings, or inconsistencies
## Conduct a Systematic Literature Review
- Use databases and search engines to find comprehensive research papers
- Utilize keywords and search terms related to your research topic.
- Assess the existing literature to identify areas with limited or contradictory findings.

## Analyze Limitations in Current Studies
- Examine the "limitations" sections of articles for areas that need further exploration.
- Identify where studies fail to address specific populations, settings, or variables.
- Note gaps in methodology, such as small sample sizes or lack of longitudinal data.

## Identify Contradictory Findings
- Look for inconsistencies in results across studies on the same topic
- Analyze why these contradictions exist (e.g., differences in methodology or population).
- Highlight these areas as potential avenues for further research.
  
## Explore Emerging Trends and Technologies
- Monitor advances in technology, tools, or methods that could open new research possibilities.
- Check interdisciplinary fields where concepts or approaches may not yet be widely applied

## Consult Experts and Stakeholders
- Engage with professors, advisors, or field practitioners to understand unmet research needs.
- Participate in academic conferences or webinars to learn about ongoing debates and open questions.
- Network with researchers and discuss potential research gaps.
- Seek insights from experts in your field through collaborations or mentorship.
- Engage in discussions with fellow researchers and colleagues
- Benefit from their expertise and perspectives on potential research gaps

## Use Research Gap Tools
- Utilize tools like systematic review frameworks or Al-driven platforms' g., Litmaps, Research Rabbit) to identify underexplored areas.
- Analyze citation networks to see which topics lack sufficient refere ices.

## Frame the Gap Clearly
- Articulate the gap as a specific question or problem. For example:
- "Few studies examine the long-term effects of [intervention] in [population]."
- "No research explores how [variable] impacts [outcome] in [context]
