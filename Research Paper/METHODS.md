# What is Research Methodology?

Def: Describe tools/ techniques/ data instruments and design to be used for analyzing and validating the research work

Def: Methodology section describes the research design, sample size, data collection methods, and analysis techniques employed in your study. The methodology section outlines how you conducted your research, including details about sample selection, data collection methods, and data analysis techniques.

Def: This section provides all the methodologies details necessary for another scientist to duplicate your work.

Def: This section aims to provide details of your methodological approach to your research and data analysis; What to do and how to solve the problem, Which research method (Survey, modeling, cases study ) will be used Type of data and its source should be briefed, Time duration of your research Total cost of incurred on your research



# Guidline about Methodology Section?
Here are some guidelines for presenting methodology

- It should be a narrative of the steps you took in your experiment or study not a list of instructions such as you might find in a cookbook. An 
important part of writing a scientific paper is deciding what bit of information needs to be given in detail.
- Do not quote or cite your laboratory manual. Sometimes experimental details are given as a supplement.
- The methods section should describe how you conducted your research. This could include information about the data that you collected, the methods that you used to analyze the data, and the limitations of your research.
- Describe tools/ techniques/ data instruments and design to be used for analyzing and validating the research work
- Provide clear descriptions: Clearly explain the steps you took to collect data and analyze it so that other researchers can replicate your study if needed.
- Include  Subsections: Participants,tools procedures
- write in lcear logical steps
- each subsection <300 words

# How to write Methodology

## 1. Provide an Overview
Start by briefly introducing the purpose of the
methodology section:
- Explain the objective of your research.
- Highlight the approach or methods used (quantitative, qualitative, mixed).

Example: "This section outlines the methods and procedures used to investigate the impact of Al on education using a mixed-methods approach."

## 2. Explain the Research Design
**Clearly define your research framework**: 
• State the type of research (e.g., experimental, observational, correlational).
• Describe your study's scope (e.g., cross-sectional, longitudinal).
**Example:** "A quantitative cross-sectional study design was adopted to analyze trends in Al-based learning systems."

## 3. Describe Data Collection Methods

**Detail how you gathered your data:**

• Tools (e.g., surveys, interviews, experiments, sensors).

• Data sources (e.g., participants, datasets, case studies)

Sampling techniques (e.g., random sampling, purposive sampling).

Justify why the method was chosen.

**Example:** "Primary data was collected through structured online surveys distributed among 200
university professors. A random sampling technique ensured unbiased participant selection."
·
## 4. Explain the Procedure
**Describe the step-by-step process of how the study was conducted:**
-  How participants were involved.
-  Any materials or technologies used.
-   nstructions given or tests conducted.
-   
**Example**: "Participants were first provided with an orientation on the study's purpose,
driven learning module."

## 5. Data Analysis

**Explain how you analyzed the data:**
- Statistical tools (e.g., SPSS, Python, R).
- Techniques (e.g., regression, t-tests, thematic analysis).
- How results were interpreted.
  
**Example:** "Quantitative data were analyzed using Python for statistical analysis, including correlation and regression techniques. Qualitative responses were categorized through thematic analysis."

## 6. Mention Tools/Equipment

**If applicable, include:**

- Software (e.g., MATLAB, NVivo, TensorFlow). Experimental setups (e.g., laboratory equipment).
- Algorithms (for AI/ML studies).
  
**Example:** "A CNN-based model was developed using TensorFlow to classify the collected medical images."

##  7. Address Validity and Reliability
**Discuss how you ensured the research's credibility:**
- Reliability (e.g., consistent procedures).
- Validity (e.g., tested survey questions).
- Steps to minimize bias.

Example: "The questionnaire was pre-tested with a small focus group to ensure clarity and reliability of responses."

##  8. Highlight Limitations
** Briefly note any constraints of your methodology (optional, but adds transparency):**
- Sample size.
- Scope limitations.  
**Example:** "The sample size was limited to 200 participants due to resource constraints, which may affect the generalizability of findings."

# Tense

- The methods section should use the **past tense** because it is a report of what was done during the course of the study ,” we tested independently derived cultures for resistance to trimethoprim”.
- When one action occurred before another, the **past perfect tense** can be used to indicate the earlier action, with the subsequent action in the **simple past tense**. The past perfect tense is formed by combining the word ‘had’ with the past participle (typically the ‘-ed’ or ‘-en’ form) of a verb.
- Examples combining the past and past perfect tenses include “the cells that had been irradiated [past perfect] were assayed [past] for DNA damage” and “patients who had elected [past perfect] to undergo surgery completed [past] questionnaires.”
- In rare cases in which one action occurred while another was ongoing, the past progressive is used [1]. (e.g., “while the cells were incubating [past progressive], the temperature was raised [past] 1°C per hour” or “while patients were preparing [past progressive] for surgery, nurses collected [past] baseline samples”).
- Present passive is used to describe what is normally done or to describe a standard procedure. Describes standard procedures. Example: “Data collection is performed using surveys”
- Past passive is used to describe what you did yourself . Details specific actions you took. Example: “The samples were analyzed using X- ray diffraction.

# Reviewer Comments

- The manuscript should provide more details about the features and make it understandable to readers.
- No technical details about the used techniques are provided in the paper.
- IN the Materials & Methods phase, needs to describe the approaches and logic that the authors have used.
- The manuscript lacks sufficient detail regarding model tuning and experimental control. Most models appear to be run with default parameters, which limits the strength of performance comparisons. Please provide clarification on the data splitting strategy (e.g., stratified 10-fold cross-validation), random seed control, and whether data leakage was prevented.
- Hyperparameter tuning should be performed or justified, particularly for deep learning models that are sensitive to configuration
- Class Imbalance and Performance Metrics The dataset exhibits strong class imbalance, especially in the "Minimal" and "Minor" injury classes, which most models fail to classify accurately. While SMOTE is mentioned, its impact is not evaluated, and no alternative balancing strategies are tested.Include per-class metrics (precision, recall, F1) for a more comprehensive evaluation, and report macro/micro averages. Consider using additional sampling techniques or cost-sensitive methods to improve minority class performance.
-  Dataset Compatibility and Generalisability. The KSI and RTA datasets differ in structure, duration, and geographical context. Direct comparison should be supported by a harmonisation strategy or limitations clearly acknowledged.
-  Include a discussion on cultural, infrastructural, and policy differences that may affect the generalizability of findings.
