# What is the research Gap?

We define a research gap as a topic or area for which missing or inadequate information limits the ability of reviewers to reach a conclusion for a given question.

# üß† Types of Research Gap

| **Research Gap**           | **Definition**                                 | **Example**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Evidence Gap**            | Lack of empirical data                        | Limited data on long-term mental health benefits of telemedicine for elderly patients. |
| **Knowledge Gap**           | Lack of theoretical understanding             | No solid framework explaining why mobile apps improve diabetic health outcomes. |
| **Practical-Knowledge Gap** | Theory-practice disconnect                    | VR therapy is effective for pain management but rarely implemented in hospitals. |
| **Population Gap**          | Certain groups overlooked                     | Hypertension research focused on urban, neglects rural populations. |
| **Methodological Gap**      | Need for improved methods                     | Relying on self-reports instead of wearables for dietary data in chronic disease patients. |
| **Theoretical Gap**         | Lack of unified theory                        | No comprehensive model explaining chronic pain intervention effectiveness. |
| **Geographical Gap**        | Regionally limited research                   | COVID-19 vaccine studies focused on high-income countries, limited studies in low-income regions. |
| **Empirical Gap**           | Unexplored variable interactions              | Lack of empirical studies linking stress levels to cancer recovery rates. |
| **Conceptual Gap**          | Underdeveloped concept or idea                | Undefined framework for ‚Äúpersonalized treatments‚Äù in precision medicine. |
| **Temporal Gap**            | Lack of time-based follow-up research         | Initial telehealth studies during COVID-19 need longitudinal follow-up. |
