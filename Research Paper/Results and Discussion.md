# What Are “Results” in a Research Study??

Presentation and interpretation of the findings obtained from your research. The results section presents the findings obtained from your study. This section aims to present the key results you produced in due course of your research. This section presents the results of the study but does not attempt to interpret their meaning. 

The Results section presents the findings obtained during the research process. Its purpose is to report the outcomes clearly and objectively, without interpreting their implications. Interpretation and meaning are addressed later in the Discussion section. Results are typically summarized using text supported by tables, graphs, or figures, rather than raw data.

-  Present your findings and provide a thorough analysis.
-  Use tables, figures, and charts to enhance understanding.
-  Summarize key results.

# Key Characteristics of an Effective Results Section

Here are some guidelines for presenting results:
- Include only information relevant to answering the research questions or objectives.
- As with the method section, the trick to writing a good result section is knowing what information to include or exclude.
- You will not present the raw data that you collect, but rather you will summarise the data with text, tables, and or figures. Use the text of the paper to state the results of your study, then refer the reader to a table or figure where they can see the data for themselves.
- Present summarized data using text, tables, and figures—avoid listing raw data.
- one trick is to follow the section of the method or key topics you feel are important and make a list of these before you write the result
- The results section should present the findings of your research. This could include tables, graphs, or other visuals to help to illustrate your findings.
- Use appropriate visuals: Utilize tables, graphs, charts, or figures to present your results visually and enhance reader comprehension.
- should be ordered around primary and secondary outcomes in the same order as listed in the methods section
- State results clearly using both words and numerical values.
- Make your Results and Discussion (R&D) concise but informative
- Focus on the important parts, not the small details
- Keep the main things the main thing
- support descriptions with details on the model, data, and statistical analyses
- Present findings in the same order as the primary and secondary outcomes described in the Methods section.
- move from general to specific
- Use the text to highlight key findings and refer readers to relevant tables or visualizations for details.
- Organize results according to the methodology or major themes identified earlier
- Use visuals (tables, charts, graphs) to enhance clarity and comprehension.

# Result Breakdown

- Baseline sub group cross sectiona table 1
- Main questions figures/tables data in text readable
- Secondary questions idem
- Unexpected observation very short


# How to write Result Section 
-Do not duplicate information in text and tables

# Tense in Result Sections

- **Past Tense:** Details findings or observations. Example: “The experiments showed a 20% increase in efficiency. "Because the experiments described in the text were completed before the paper was written the results section of a manuscript is also largely written using the past tense (for example, “we detected no fluorescence in the control sample”. Explains the results obtained. Example: "The results indicated a significant increase in efficiency."
- **Present tense:** Explains results and significance. Example: “The results indicate a strong correlation between variables. "In certain cases, however, the present tense is needed. As described above for the introduction section, the present tense is appropriate when referring to the entire paper or to individual elements of the manuscript. Examples of statements for which the present tense is the best to include. For example “our results demonstrate that magnesium is essential for enzymatic function,”.
- **Combination:** Interprets findings while referring to results. Example: “The data suggest that temperature changes affected growth rates.” Describes figures, tables, diagrams, and their significance. Example: "Table 1 shows the correlation between variables."For summarizing and interpreting findings.
Example: "The data showed a clear trend, which suggests that further research is needed."


# Reviewer Comments about Result Section 

- The results must be validated and compared with standard or similar results in the literature
- The experimental results are not convincing. Please add more comparisons with recently published solutions.
- How do you benchmark your work? How do you evaluate it? You report the outcome without having any comparisons or benchmarking
- Present tense is used to present the diagram , Figure , table and images. Present tense is also used to explain significance of the results
- Past tense is used to detail the result obtained .You may use past tense to summarize your findings in combination with present tense to interpret or explain the result
- Class Imbalance and Performance Metrics The dataset exhibits strong class imbalance, especially in the "Minimal" and "Minor" injury classes, which most models fail to classify accurately. While SMOTE is mentioned, its impact is not evaluated, and no alternative balancing strategies are tested. Include per-class metrics (precision, recall, F1) for a more comprehensive evaluation, and report macro/micro averages. Consider using additional sampling techniques or cost-sensitive methods to improve minority class performance.

# What is mean by Discussion Section ?

This section aims to share your reflections on your results and benchmark the new knowledge with the previous knowledge, and define any practical application of your work.in this section, you are free to explain what the results mean or why they differ from what other workers have found.

## Discussion Breakdown

- Bottom line main result(s) message implication
- Comparison with earlier studie what is different what is new
- Weakness/strength design/methods bias, statistical power: be honest
- Interpretation and Mechanisms what is solved? and what is not
- Clinical interpretation medical relevance
- Conclusion with Implication Suggestion

# Key traits of a good Discussion Section 
- Make your Results and Discussion (R&D) concise but informative
- Focus on the important parts, not the small details
- Remember that discussion of unexpected results is often as valuable as focusing on the expected findings
- you should interpret your results in light of other published results, By adding additional information from a source you cited in the introduction section as well as by introducing new sources. ensure you provide accurate citations.
- Relate your discussion back to the objective and questions you raised in the introduction section, however, do not simply re-state the objective. Make statements that synthesize all the evidence( include previous work and the current works)
- limit your conclusions to those that your data can actually support. you can then proceed to speculate on why this occurred and whether you expected this to occur based on other workers finding Suggest future directions for research, new methods explanations for deviations from previously published results, etc
- Do not write an expensive essay that extrapolates widely from what you found
- Discuss both strengths and weaknesses
- Relate your study to what has been already found
- How does your result fit in with what is already known
- What are the strengths and weaknesses of your study compared to previous studies
- what does your paper offer a different conclusion
- Discuss what your study means
- do not overstate the importance of your findings readers will probably come to their own conclusions on this issue.
- What did your research not address? Avoid using the cliche more research is needed


# How to write Discussion Section
- Start the discussion with a single sentence that states your main finding

# Reviewer Comments about Discussion Section

- The discussion is weak, and not much value is added to the body of knowledge
- Accuracy alone is not sufficient for model evaluation, particularly with imbalanced data. Please include AUC-ROC for each class or provide weighted scores.
- While DL models are said to perform worse due to dataset size, no empirical evidence (e.g., learning curves or training loss) is provided. Consider including such analysis or tempering the claim.
- The manuscript is lengthy and repetitive in places. Please revise for clarity, conciseness, and tone consistency (avoid switching between first-person and third-person narrative). Ensure that all figures and tables are clearly labelled and explicitly referenced in 
  the text. Captions should explain key findings, not just describe the visual. Correct typographical and formatting errors (e.g., “KNN-KSTM” likely refers to KNN-LSTM).
