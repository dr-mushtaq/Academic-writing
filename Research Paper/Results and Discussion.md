# What is mean by Results?

Presentation and interpretation of the findings obtained from your research. The results section presents the findings obtained from your study. This section aims to present the key results you produced in due course of your research. This section presents the results of the study but does not attempt to interpret their meaning. 

# Key traits of a Good Results Section

Here are some guidelines for presenting results:
- As with the method section, the trick to writing a good result section is knowing what information to include or exclude.
- You will not present the raw data that you collect, but rather you will summarise the data with text, tables, and or figures. Use the text of the paper to state the results of your study, then refer the reader to a table or figure where they can see the data for themselves.
- one trick is to follow the section of the method or key topics you feel are important and make a list of these before you write the result
- The results section should present the findings of your research. This could include tables, graphs, or other visuals to help to illustrate your findings.
- Use appropriate visuals: Utilize tables, graphs, charts, or figures to present your results visually and enhance reader comprehension.
- should be ordered around primary and secondary outcomes in the same order as listed in the methods section
- state clearly and simply what you found using words and number
- Make your Results and Discussion (R&D) concise but informative
- Focus on the important parts, not the small details
- Keep the main things the main thing
- support descriptions with details on the model, data, and statistical analyses
- Keep it in order
- move from general to specific


# How to write Result Section 
-Do not duplicate information in text and tables

# Tense in Result Sections

- **Past Tense:** Details findings or observations. Example: “The experiments showed a 20% increase in efficiency. "Because the experiments described in the text were completed before the paper was written the results section of a manuscript is also largely written using the past tense (for example, “we detected no fluorescence in the control sample”. Explains the results obtained. Example: "The results indicated a significant increase in efficiency."
- **Present tense:** Explains results and significance. Example: “The results indicate a strong correlation between variables. "In certain cases, however, the present tense is needed. As described above for the introduction section, the present tense is appropriate when referring to the entire paper or to individual elements of the manuscript. Examples of statements for which the present tense is the best to include. For example “our results demonstrate that magnesium is essential for enzymatic function,”.
- **Combination:** Interprets findings while referring to results. Example: “The data suggest that temperature changes affected growth rates.” Describes figures, tables, diagrams, and their significance. Example: "Table 1 shows the correlation between variables."For summarizing and interpreting findings.
Example: "The data showed a clear trend, which suggests that further research is needed."


# Reviewer Comments about Result Section 

- The results must be validated and compared with standard or similar results in the literature
- The experimental results are not convincing. Please add more comparisons with recently published solutions.
- How do you benchmark your work? How do you evaluate it? You report the outcome without having any comparisons or benchmarking
- Present tense is used to present the diagram , Figure , table and images. Present tense is also used to explain significance of the results
- Past tense is used to detail the result obtained .You may use past tense to summarize your findings in combination with present tense to interpret or explain the result
- Class Imbalance and Performance Metrics The dataset exhibits strong class imbalance, especially in the "Minimal" and "Minor" injury classes, which most models fail to classify accurately. While SMOTE is mentioned, its impact is not evaluated, and no alternative balancing strategies are tested. Include per-class metrics (precision, recall, F1) for a more comprehensive evaluation, and report macro/micro averages. Consider using additional sampling techniques or cost-sensitive methods to improve minority class performance.

# What is mean by Discussion Section ?

This section aims to share your reflections on your results and benchmark the new knowledge with the previous knowledge, and define any practical application of your work.in this section, you are free to explain what the results mean or why they differ from what other workers have found.

# Key traits of a good Discussion Section 
- Make your Results and Discussion (R&D) concise but informative
- Focus on the important parts, not the small details
- Remember that discussion of unexpected results is often as valuable as focusing on the expected findings
- you should interpret your results in light of other published results, By adding additional information from a source you cited in the introduction section as well as by introducing new sources. ensure you provide accurate citations.
- Relate your discussion back to the objective and questions you raised in the introduction section, however, do not simply re-state the objective. Make statements that synthesize all the evidence( include previous work and the current works)
- limit your conclusions to those that your data can actually support. you can then proceed to speculate on why this occurred and whether you expected this to occur based on other workers finding Suggest future directions for research, new methods explanations for deviations from previously published results, etc
- Do not write an expensive essay that extrapolates widely from what you found
- Discuss both strengths and weaknesses
- Relate your study to what has been already found



# How to write Discussion Section
- Start the discussion with a single sentence that states your main finding

# Why Finding a Research Gap Matters?

Discovering a research gap allows you to:
- Contribute new insights to your discipline.
- Avoid repeating existing work.
- Strengthen your research proposal or thesis.
- Build on areas that need further exploration.
- Boosts originality and innovation.
- Makes your research sharply focused. Helps solve real-world or academic problems.
- Promotes interdisciplinary knowledge growth.
- Makes your work more publishable and fundable
  
When reviewers read your paper, one of the first things they check is whether your study fills a meaningful gap.

# Types of Research Gap

| **Research Gap**           | **Definition**                                 | **Example**                                                                 |

# How to Identigy Research Gap
## Review Existing Literature
- Use reliable databases like PubMed, Scopus, or Google Scholar to find peer- reviewed articles.
- Focus on recent studies to ensure you understand the latest developments in your field.
- Look for patterns, trends, and limitations in the studies you read.
- Identify recurring themes, unanswered questions, or areas of controversy.
- Look for gaps in knowledge, conflicting findings, or inconsistencies
## Conduct a Systematic Literature Review
- Use databases and search engines to find comprehensive research papers
- Utilize keywords and search terms related to your research topic.
- Assess the existing literature to identify areas with limited or contradictory findings.

## Analyze Limitations in Current Studies
- Examine the "limitations" sections of articles for areas that need further exploration.
- Identify where studies fail to address specific populations, settings, or variables.
- Note gaps in methodology, such as small sample sizes or lack of longitudinal data.

## Identify Contradictory Findings
- Look for inconsistencies in results across studies on the same topic
- Analyze why these contradictions exist (e.g., differences in methodology or population).
- Highlight these areas as potential avenues for further research.
  
## Explore Emerging Trends and Technologies
- Monitor advances in technology, tools, or methods that could open new research possibilities.
- Check interdisciplinary fields where concepts or approaches may not yet be widely applied

## Consult Experts and Stakeholders
- Engage with professors, advisors, or field practitioners to understand unmet research needs.
- Participate in academic conferences or webinars to learn about ongoing debates and open questions.
- Network with researchers and discuss potential research gaps.
- Seek insights from experts in your field through collaborations or mentorship.
- Engage in discussions with fellow researchers and colleagues
- Benefit from their expertise and perspectives on potential research gaps

## Use Research Gap Tools
- Utilize tools like systematic review frameworks or Al-driven platforms' g., **Litmaps**, **Research Rabbit**) to identify underexplored areas.
- Analyze citation networks to see which topics lack sufficient refere ices.
- Answerthis Al-Al-powered literature
- Jenni Al- Real-time assis- tance in content generation
- SciSpace Reflect, brain- storm, and test logic
- Aveksana Explore over- looked popula- tions & trends

## Frame the Gap Clearly
- Articulate the gap as a specific question or problem. For example:
- "Few studies examine the long-term effects of [intervention] in [population]."
- "No research explores how [variable] impacts [outcome] in [context]

# Key traits of a good Research Gap

1. Specific - Not vague or too broad
2. Timely - Relevant in current academic or real-world discourse
3. Evidence-Based - Backed by review and data, not just assump- tions
4. Actionable Can lead to measurable study or experiment
5. Impactful - Likely to advance knowledge or change practice
