# 📝 1. Write in a Formal Tone

Academic writing avoids casual or conversational language. Instead, it uses formal structures that sound professional and precise.

## 🔹 Key features of formal writing:

Passive voice (when appropriate)

Avoid phrasal verbs

Use nominalisation (turning verbs into nouns)

Avoid contractions

Avoid personal pronouns

Use hedging to show caution

Reference ideas properly

## 🔹 Example

❌ We found out that the results don’t match the previous study.
✔️ It was discovered that the results do not correspond with those of the previous study.

Why?

“Found out” is informal → replaced with “discovered”

No contraction (“don’t → do not”)

Passive voice adds objectivity

# 🧍 2. Maintain an Impersonal Style

Academic writing focuses on ideas, not the writer.

## 🔹 Key features:

Avoid “I”, “we”, and “you”

Use passive voice when necessary

## 🔹 Example

❌ I believe this method is more accurate.
✔️ This method appears to be more accurate.

Why?

Removes personal opinion

Maintains academic distance

# 🎯 3. Stay Objective

Objectivity means presenting arguments based on facts — not emotions, personal bias, or one-sided reasoning.

🔹 Key features:

Balance both sides of an argument

Use critical thinking

Avoid emotional words

Avoid sexist language

🔹 Example

❌ This new policy is terrible because students hate it.
✔️ The effectiveness of the new policy has been questioned due to decreased student satisfaction.

Why?

Neutral, balanced wording

Based on observations, not emotions

# 📚 4. Make Your Writing Evidence-Based

Every claim must be supported with credible sources.

🔹 Key features:

Use data, facts, and statistics

Cite references

Avoid unsupported claims

🔹 Example

❌ Online learning is better than traditional learning.
✔️ A comparative study by Johnson (2023) found that online learning improved student engagement by 18%.

Why?

Backed with evidence

Provides authority

# 🎯 5. Be Precise

Academic writing requires exact, clear, and relevant wording.

🔹 Key features:

Avoid irrelevant information

Stay focused on the topic

Avoid vague language (“waffle”)

Choose exact words

🔹 Example

❌ There are many different kinds of problems in the system, and they cause many issues for users.
✔️ System latency and authentication errors are the primary issues reported by users.

Why?

Direct, focused, specific

# 📐 6. Use a Structured Approach

Good academic writing has a logical flow that guides the reader clearly from one idea to another.

🔹 Key features:

Coherent and logical structure

Clear paragraphing

Cohesive devices (however, therefore, in contrast)

Appropriate complex sentences without losing clarity

🔹 Example

❌ Machine learning models are widely used. They have many applications. These include finance, health, and marketing.
✔️ Machine learning models are widely used across multiple domains; for example, they are commonly applied in finance, healthcare, and marketing.

Why?

Sentences flow logically

More cohesive and syntactically clear

🎉 Final Thoughts
