
# Description:

The problem statement provides a clear and concise description of the issue that needs to be addressed. A research problem addresses an existing gap in knowledge in your field and leads to further investigations by you and other researchers. Ithe problem statement provides the “punch” or “clarity.” Without its presence, a manuscript lacks focus.All research projects should start with a clear problem statement. A problem statement is a formulation of an issue that is usually a ‘gap’ within your area.

# **🧩 Attributes of Problem Statements** 

A research problem statement has Following key attributes:

1. Clarity and precision: a well-written statement that does not make sweeping generalizations and
irresponsible statements, and that is not wordy;
2. Identification of what would be studied while avoiding the use of value-laden words and terms;
3. Identification of an overarching question and key factors or variables;
4. Definition of key concepts/terms;
5. Articulation of study’s boundaries or parameters;
6. Some generalizability;
7. Conveyance of study’s importance, benefits, and justification (addresses the question of “so
what?“);
8. No use of unnecessary jargon; and
9. Conveyance of more than the gathering of descriptive data providing a “snapshot.
10. he problem must be challenging and original, but also potentially achievable by your team.
11. The problem must not be incremental. In other words, don't try to address a small change or advance on an existing study that leads to no new scientific insight. This could be damaging to your and your team's reputation, and will likely not lead to a meaningful publication.
12. Developing a ‘good' research problem statement, therefore, involves systematic planning and setting time-based, realistic objectives. Your problem has to be achievable

## **✅ Key Guidelines to Writing Problem Statements**

Step 1- Problem/Issue: Complete the sentence: the problem is...what...for who...where.

Step 2- Research Design: Completing the statement: this(type of design) study will do what (explore, describe) what (topic) by

doing what (interviewing, observing) who (subjects, population) where (location). (qualitative study will include information about
research pattern triangulated).

Step 3- Impact: one-line about who/what will be affected by the final results.

Step 4- Theoretical Contextualisation: citing theories to validate the importance of the study.

Stating a research problem is done by defining it within the general area of your research. This depends on your previous work and experience. It may be an area you want to move into or a topic related to what you have already worked on as a researcher. Examples could include a question in astrophysics within physics, robotics within engineering, nutrition within medicine, or marine biology within ocean and Earth science.

Once you've determined your overall area (and you'll know this already of course), it's time to drill down, decide, and define a research problem within that field.

First, your statement should identify a problem that needs to be addressed within your selected sub-area.

This will almost certainly require literature work, but the idea may arise from:

- Discussions you've had with colleagues;
- Discussions at a conference;
- A paper you've read.

Second, your problem statement should be a “good research problem.” This will require further investigation and reading as you consider “what has been done?” and “what needs to be done?”
